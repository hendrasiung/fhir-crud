This is a single page web app to view FHIR resource from a FHIR repository. If you want to view resources in your own FHIR repository, there may be 2 changes in the source code:

1 You will need to change the line containing 'Vue.http.intercepters' with the authentication method access to your FHIR repository.

2 You will need to add/remove FHIR resource categories.
